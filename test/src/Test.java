// Ramu has N dishes of different types arranged in a row: A1,A2,â€¦,AN where Ai denotes the type of the ith dish. He wants to choose as many dishes as possible from the given list but while satisfying two conditions:

// He can choose only one type of dish.
// No two chosen dishes should be adjacent to each other.
// Ramu wants to know which type of dish he should choose from, so that he can pick the maximum number of dishes.
